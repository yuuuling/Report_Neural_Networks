# Report_Neural_Networks
This final report presents a comprehensive statistical analysis and time-series forecasting of renewable energy trends using dataset 160060 from Taiwan’s Open Data Platform (data.gov.tw). Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques—including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models—the study explores temporal patterns and predicts future renewable energy outputs. All analyses and modeling were implemented in R, aiming to support data-driven decision-making in sustainable energy management.
Data source: Taiwan Open Data Platform (dataset 160060).
